Express js
Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications, making it easier to manage server-side logic, routing, middleware, and more.
Key Features of Express.js:
1. Middleware: Express.js uses middleware functions to handle requests and responses. Middleware can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, parsing request bodies, and more.
2. Routing: Express.js provides a powerful routing system that allows developers to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and URL patterns.
3. Templating Engines: Express.js supports various templating engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars, allowing developers to generate dynamic HTML content.
4. Static File Serving: Express.js can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files easily using built-in middleware.
5. RESTful APIs: Express.js is commonly used to build RESTful APIs due to its simplicity and flexibility.
6. Extensibility: Express.js has a large ecosystem of third-party middleware and plugins that can be easily integrated to extend its functionality.

# Express js is a framework of Node js

Features - 
         # Simple routing. get() and post().
         # json conversion - res.json() makes it easy
         # Static files handling - express.static() serves files easily
         # Cleaner and shorter code.

Steps : 
        # npm init -y
        # npm i express
        # app.js/server.js
        # require express, create app, create endpoint(port), start the app using 'listen callback fn'.


Dynamic HTML - EJS

steps : 
        # npm i EJS
        # app.set('view engine', 'ejs');  - in app.js
        # create views folder
        # .render() is used instead of json() and .send()

installing Express.js:
npm init -y
npm install express

installing nodemon (optional, for development):
npm i nodemon
npm install -g nodemon

installing ejs (optional, for templating):
npm install ejs

all together:
npm install express -g nodemon ejs mongoose body-parser

# Authentication - who are you? (login,signup, verify user credentials).
# Authorization - What are you allowed to?(Admin access, protected routes, permissions)

Authentication in Express - 

# bcrypt is used to hash a password - make it to unreadable form.
# hashing is one way. can't change back to old format.
# encryption is two way. we can decrypt that.
# using of "salt" (salt is random characters) is used to make the hashing more efficient.
